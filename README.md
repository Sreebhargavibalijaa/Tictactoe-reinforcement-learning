# Tictactoe-reinforcement-learning
We have implemented grid world game by iteratively updating Q value function, which is the estimating value of (state, action) pair. This time let’s look into how to leverage reinforcement learning in adversarial game — tic-tac-toe, where there are more states and actions and most importantly, there is an opponent playing against our agent
